Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4):
Version: 4
This indicates that the packet is using IPv4.

Header Length: 20 bytes
This specifies the length of the IP header. Since it’s 20 bytes, there are no options present.

Differentiated Services Field: 0x00
DSCP: CS0 (Class Selector 0)
ECN: Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)
This field is used for Quality of Service (QoS) purposes.

Total Length: 399 bytes
This is the entire length of the IP packet, including both the header and the data.

Identification: 0xefc3 (61379)
This is an identifier for the group of fragments of a single IP datagram.

Flags: 0x00
Bit 0 (Reserved): 0 (must be zero)
Bit 1 (Don't Fragment): 0
Bit 2 (More Fragments): 0
Since all flag bits are zero, this packet is not fragmented.
Fragment Offset: 0

This field is used if the IP packet is fragmented. In this case, it’s 0, indicating that this is not a fragment.
Time to Live (TTL): 255
This field specifies the maximum number of hops the packet can take before being discarded. The initial value of 255 is the maximum, suggesting it hasn't traversed any routers yet.

Protocol: 17 (UDP)
This indicates that the next layer protocol is UDP.

Header Checksum: 0x27cc (validation disabled)
This is used to verify the integrity of the IP header. In this case, validation is disabled.

Source Address: 192.168.1.10
This is the IP address of the sender.

Destination Address: 224.0.0.251
This is the IP address of the receiver. The address 224.0.0.251 is a multicast address used for mDNS (Multicast DNS).
